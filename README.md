##FRAMEWORK/LIBARIES USED
The Booksy Library System is built using the following technologies:
- HTML5 – For structuring all web pages and system interfaces.
- CSS3 – For styling, layout design, and overall visual appearance.
- JavaScript – For interactive features and client-side functionality.
- Bootstrap 5 – For responsive design, grid layout, and pre-built UI components.
- Google Fonts – For improved typography throughout the system.
These tools were used to create a simple, responsive, and user-friendly library management interface hosted via GitHub Pages.
